<h1>🚀 Parallel Task Engine</h1>

<h3>📝 Description:</h3>

Parallel Task Engine is a full-stack project demonstrating **concurrent task execution** using a thread pool in Java (Spring Boot) with a React frontend. It simulates how real-world backend systems, like web servers or job schedulers, handle multiple tasks **efficiently and reliably**. ⚡

<h3>⚙️ How it Works</h3>

1. User submits a task via frontend. 📝  
2. Spring Boot backend adds it to the task queue. 📥  
3. Worker threads execute tasks concurrently. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️  
4. Frontend displays live task status and worker info. 👀
